#### with npm
```
cd SmartHomeSimulatorFront
npm install
```

### Installation for Back-End

Smart Home Simulator uses java 11 for the backend 

It also uses maven and Spring boot but you don't have to download anything for that part (more details in README.md in SmartHomeSimulatorBack folder

Install jdk 11.0.8 or newer to be able to run the code

IntelliJ as a text editor is perfect but Eclipse or Netbeans can be used as well


### To test the App with Back-End

Start the app with yarn or npm.
Run the project inside the folder SmartHomeSimulatorBack (Folder name: SmartHomeSimulator) using your text editor.

First time running the code of backend? 
	Don't forget to assign the right jdk to be able to run it. (IntelliJ will ask)
	
### If it works

You'll see the Spring logo appear in your console and all the services starting in port 8080.
